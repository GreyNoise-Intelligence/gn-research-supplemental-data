Fingerprints-and-Domains.csv
  - High-value JA4T/JA4H fingerprints for detection
  - OAST callback domain patterns for DNS sinkholing

# Usage Recommendations

IMMEDIATE BLOCKING:

- Import IP lists into firewall/SIEM blocklists
- Prioritize HIGH confidence IPs
- Block OAST domains via DNS sinkhole

DETECTION RULES:

- Alert on JA4T fingerprint: 65495_2-4-8-1-3_65495_7
- Alert on DNS queries to *.oast.live, *.oast.pro, *.interact.sh
- Alert on HTTP requests to /quarantine* paths

THREAT HUNTING:

- Search logs for activity from listed IPs during Jan 12-20
- Check for successful authentications following brute force attempts
- Review Spring Cloud Gateway logs for OAST callback patterns
